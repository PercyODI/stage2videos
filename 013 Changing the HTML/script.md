- Now to add interactivity to the page
- Add the script element to the head
- I want to update the title to welcome a person by name to the page
- Create a function that can be called
    - submitUsername()
    - no parameters, yet
- Now I need to get the button to call the function (onclick)
- Ok, back in the function, I want to change the inner text of the title.
- Before that, I want to get the value the user typed into the text box.
    - Agh! HTMLCollections
- Ok, now that I have the HTML element, how do I get the value out
