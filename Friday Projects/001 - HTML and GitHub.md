# Welcome

Dear *\<INSERT NAME HERE>*,

Hello, and welcome to ***GrillTec INC***, the most advanced grill-based technology company in America! We pride ourselves on delivering top-quality software, and are so happy that you have joined us as a full-stack software developer!

You and your team have been tasked with developing a new app idea coming straight from R&D: GrillBer! I know, you are just as excited as we are! 

You will be provided with the instructional videos created by our in-house R&D specialist *\<R&D Specialist Name>* as he was developing a side project call RealTimeDiary. Unfortunately this project had to be scrapped due to copyright infringement and its lack of grill-based opportunities.

## What is GrillBer?

GrillBer is exactly like it sounds: Uber for grills! Let me set the scene. You live in a dense urban environment, in a studio apartment on the 20th floor of an apartment building, but you want to put on a cookout! You don't have the space or the budget to buy a high quality grill, but your local park doesn't provide public access grills for your cookout. What do you do?

That's where GrillBer comes in! GrillBer is a deliver service for grill rentals! Grill owners can put up the specs and descriptions for their grills, and users can rent them for specific amounts of time! The grill owner will drop off the grill at the designated time and location, and then pick it back up when the user is finished!

Just think of the possibilities! 

## What do we need **now**?

Because we are a completely agile tech shop, we believe in small, incremental development. Each week we will specify what requirements we need to be delivered. And to keep the feedback loop as short as possible, we want the code out in the world as soon as each feature is delivered!

## But how should it look?

GrillBer is known for its grill based technology, and just like grills we don't need any fancy bells and whistles. We believe in a strong, functional product over a flashy UI. We will leave the design of the site up to you as the developers!
