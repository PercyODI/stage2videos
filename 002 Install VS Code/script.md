Hello, and welcome to Stage Two: Installing Visual Studio Code. In this video, we will be covering how to install Visual Studio Code. 

I prefer to use Visual Studio Code, or VS Code for short, to do Front End Development. It is excellent for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which we will be learning all three! It is extremely extensible, and the community has written many great extensions for VS Code. Not to mention it is all open source and available on GitHub!

Here are the steps for installing VS Code:

1. Go to code.visualstudio.com
2. Click "Download for Windows" in the middle left
    - Be sure not to click the down arrow button
3. Once the file is downloaded, run it.
    - Accept the license agreement
    - Use the default destination location
    - Use the default Start Menu folder
    - I like to check the two "Add Open with Code" actions, but not required.
    - Install
4. Click finish!

And that's it!
