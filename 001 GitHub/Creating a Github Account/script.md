Hello, and welcome to Stage Two: Creating a GitHub Account. In this video, we will be covering how to sign up for your free GitHub account, as well as talk about some of the features we get from git and GitHub. 

Source Control is vital to development. It allows us as developers to track changes and collaborate on source code. What do I mean by source code? Source code is the english we write in notepad or vim or wherever you are comfortable. Source code is the code you wrote when you were learning C in VUCS. These are the dot c files you created. Source code is not the binary that is created when the source code is compiled, such as dot out, dot h, or dot o files.

For our source control system, we will be using git and GitHub. git is a distributed source control system that does not technically require a central server, but using GitHub as our central server gives us a lot of power and features.

Here are the steps to creating your first GitHub Account. If you already have a GitHub Account, you can skip these steps.

- Go to github.com
- Click "Sign Up" in the upper right
- Pick a username for your account. Remember that this is a professional site. Think more linkedin, and less myspace.
- Type an address for you account. I would recommend using a personal email you won't lose any time soon.
- Pick a secure password (vucsOnlineP4ssword!)
- Verify your humanity
- Click Next: Select a Plan 
- Choose the free plan
- Fill out the welcome to GitHub page with whatever you want to share. GitHub will use this information to recommend repositories to you.
- Verify your email address

Let's look around a little bit. If you click on your profile link, it will take you to your personal overview page. Here you can see any pinned repositories and contribution activity. Employers will often look at a candidate's GitHub page to get a better feeling of what kind of work they can do.

Next, let's click on the repositories page. This is where all of your repos live. Let's talk about what a repo is:

Repositories, or repos for short, are kind of like folders. Every project will have its own repo for holding its source code. But repos are so much more than just folders for files.

Lets take a look at a popular open source project: React.js, owned by Facebook.

At the top of the page you see all of the files and folders inside of the project. Next to the file name, you will also see the message from the last change made to it, and when that change was made.

Under the list of files, the readme is displayed. Readme's are good for explaining to other what this project is, how to install and use the project, and how others can contribute and help write the code.
The Readme file is just a special type of text file called markdown. GitHub can take the plaintext readme file, and render it into a much more visually useful page.

The next tab is the issues tab. Issues are a way of tracking things to be changed in the project. These can be bugs, installation issues, or feature requests. 

One more tab over is the Pull Requests tab. Pull requests are changes that someone has made, that they want to be merged into the actual code base. Often these pull requests are based off of issues.

Sometimes repos will have a Wiki page, to help with more in-depth documentation, guides, and FAQs. Looks like the React project has decided to put its documentation somewhere else.

Now that you have a GitHub account, I hope you start to use it as part of your developer life. As a developer at Veterans United, I use source control every day, and it has saved us from costly mistakes several times! 

In the next video, you will learn how to create your own repos and start checking code into them!
