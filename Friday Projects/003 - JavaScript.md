## Before starting GrillBer requirements

There are a lot of things happening at GrillBer, and you're work is really pushing us over and above our expectations! In fact, there is so much we want to do that we need a page that we can keep all of our to-dos!

We would like you to build a to-do app in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! It needs to do the following things:

1. Allow users to input a new to-do item
1. Allow users to remove a completed to-do item
1. Show a list of items in the order they were input
1. Under the list of items left to do, completed items should be shown in the order they were completed
    - Make it clear they are completed, such a strike-through or red!
1. Make it look good!
    - Make good color choices
    - Soften the corners so things are too sharp
1. Make it feel interactive! 
    - items should change when you hover over them!

## Requirements

1. Add a section where users can put in new grills, and add them to the table
    - If the user doesn't give all the required data, feel free to `alert` them!
1. Dynamically load table from given JSON blob
    - Ratings should be in stars. Use a picture and dynamically load the correct number of them!
1. Create a dark theme for the app
    - When users click a button, change the CSS to be dark themed!
