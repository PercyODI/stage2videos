Hello, and welcome to Stage Two: More HTML Tags. In this video, we are going to create some more content for the RealTimeDiary page for users to see. 

We left off with `index.html` and our header telling people what page they are on, but they don't know what this page is for! Under the header, I need a paragraph that explains what the page is for!

Luckily, in HTML we have the p element for paragraphs. So I'll click the end of the h1 line, press enter, then create the opening p tag with a left angle bracket, the character p, and a right angle bracket. Just like before, VS Code has already created the closing p tag for me. Now to tell people what this page is for!

Remember, to view the new content, the chrome tab needs to be refreshed.

There it is! But I really wish that the last you was emphasized, made stronger so the users really know who this app is for. Luckily, there is the strong element!

In HTML, it is easy to nest elements inside each other. I just have to add the opening and closing tags INSIDE the other element's content. So, to nest this strong element, I need to click inside the p tag where I want to start the element. Write the opening tag, left angle bracket, the word strong, and a right angle bracket.

Once again, VS Code is trying to help, but it closed the tag before the text I wanted it in. So I'm going to delete the closing tag VS Code made for me. Now I need to write the closing tag on the other side of the word you. Remember, the closing tag is a left angle bracket, a forward slash, the word strong, and a right angle bracket. 

As soon as I typed left angle bracket and forward slash, VS Code realized I was trying to close the strong tag, and finished it for me. Thank you VS Code!

Now I want to save the file, and refresh chrome to see my change! Perfect! Exactly what I wanted!

Now that we have seen the p tag, the strong tag, and nested one inside the other, we are ready for more complex elements!
